# ðŸ’¬ LangChain: Chat with SQL Databases  

This project demonstrates how to use **LangChain** with **Groq LLMs** to query and interact with your **SQL databases** (SQLite/MySQL) directly through a **Streamlit chat interface**.  

With this app, you can type natural language queries (e.g., *"Show me all students who scored more than 90"*) and the LLM will generate SQL queries under the hood, execute them, and return the results.
